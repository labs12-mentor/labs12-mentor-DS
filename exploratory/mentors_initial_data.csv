San Francisco,CA - California ,"I'm a huge fan of Lambda School and the thoughtful approach you've all taken - its income-sharing model that removes the financial burden of a tech education and invests in people's future potential, the apprenticeship model to let companies take a realistic chance on a student rather than judging resumes, and ultimately its impact towards leveling the playing field, particularly for under-valued and under-privileged demographics. I try to structure my life around bridging technical gaps of opportunity, think a lot about building a sustainable and mission-oriented career, and would love to help carve out time and care to the Lambda School as part of that. I've served as a mentor for CODE2040 and Hackbright, and currently serve on the board of a global children's nonprofit while running a data and ML consultancy focused on positive second-order effects in society, along with being an active and early member of a number of unique communities such as South Park Commons and The Cosmos.

Norwalk,CT - Connecticut ,"I believe that education can change people - not only individuals, but entire families.  My great-grandfather was a farmer in rural Indiana.  His son - my grandfather - grew up in a tiny house on the farm.  He decided to go to college instead of inheriting the farm, though, and studied physics.  At one point, he and my grandmother even decided to _bike across the country_ just so they could go to college.  He ended up with a Master's degree in Physics and came back to Indiana to teach physics and computer science.  He had seven kids, all of whom went on to college, multiple in STEM and multiple ending up with graduate degrees.  Their capacity to enrich their own lives, their children's lives, and the lives of others was multiplied considerably by my grandfather's commitment to education.  I am drawn to Lambda School in part because I see that there are so many people out there who have the potential to be successful contributors to the tech industry, enriching their lives and their families' lives, who are kept from that because they don't come from a family that went to college or whatever stereotypical background.  

I have experience working as both a data scientist and a software engineer, and I've enjoyed both.  However, my favorite job ever was as physics TA in college.  I have never had a job that was so rewarding as to help someone get to the point where a concept *clicked* for them.  I am drawn to Lambda School in no small part because of the opportunity I would have to do that again, while continuing to use the skills that I have accumulated since that time as a TA.",2,,2/22/2019 8:43pm

I was a Math major with academic ambitions who got offered a lot of money to work in the States for a big tech company. Coming from a small town in India, i accepted.

After a couple of years there i found myself in a situation where i was suddenly let go and had to find a job within 60 days or get deported. Due to my background in Math and only knowing the ex-companies tech stack, most of my immediate skills were useless in the current market. I leveled up as a true engineer in those 60 days more than i had in all the previous years combined and i lost most of any unwarranted impostor syndrome i had carried for most of my engineering career. I was hired as engineer no. 2 at one of the most promising startups(with offers at 2 others) in the valley and have been instrumental in their growth over the past two years.

I would not have been able to do that without my network of supportive and brilliant friends in the space. And that is why i would like to offer myself as a source of the same for someone else.

I did a career change, and mentors helped me throughout. I originally went to business school and interned in both consulting and investment banking. It wasn't for me. I wanted something more quantitative and I wanted to work on products and projects rather than advise on them. Thanks to great teachers back in France and advice from mentors, I was able to reposition myself for data science opportunities and joined NYU's Masters in Data Science at NYU. There, I was lucky enough to study and do research with an advisor that really deeply cared about his students outcomes. I was able to land a job as a machine learning researcher at a top startup in NYC (BenevolentAI).

I realize how lucky/privileged I was:
- privileged to afford a great business school in France 
- lucky to have had mentors early on that advised to trust myself and disregard the conventional wisdom of business class students
- lucky to find great teachers that helped me get into data science despite my unusual background
- privileged to be able to borrow money to attend NYU
- lucky to have had a great advisor and mentor at NYU that truly cared about me rather than advancing his own agenda
I want others to have the same opportunities no matter their current situation.

I really want to connect with the hustling students at Lambda. I love the constant building culture, you’ve created and it mirrors the constant designing culture I went through in art school. The best way to do design is to continue to work on your craft and it seems like lambda is setting up students to do just that regardless of discipline. I’ve spoken with a number of colleagues about the gap between where students finish college and the skills needed for their first job and the difficulty it is to fill that gap. I teach and mentor to help guide students across the chasm and to increase the pool of young designers I could eventually hire. Thank you for all the work that you do and I look forward to chatting with you soon. ",1,,4/20/2019 6:54pm
