I try to structure my life around bridging technical gaps of opportunity, think a lot about building a sustainable and mission-oriented career, and would love to help carve out time and care to the Lambda School as part of that.

       "5    Having directly mentored over 100 high school students and over 100 experienced professionals at in-person as well as online programs at MIT over the last 3 years, I know how important it is to have someone to be able to exchange ideas, overcome road blocks and reach the next step/level in one's journey. A healthy mix of realistic and encouraging feedback is so important to lift someone up or transform a bad situation / crisis in a learning opportunity. I love what lambda is doing since I came across it last summer/fall (YC startupschool) and would be happy to get involved and help. I can make nearly every time zone work (as I was doing already over the last 3 years) and I am located in Boston and SF. I could accommodate about 2-4 mentor sessions per day, depending on the time zones and students' available time slots. Happy to answer any questions you might have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "14   Lambda's mission is sorely needed to align all stakeholders in the cost/benefit of an education. I've been closely following Lambda in the news and of course Austen and @HumansOfLambda on Twitter. The stories are the heart warming results of strong work ethic, proper guidance, and a leadership which understands the importance of connecting upwards to the potential employers. This mentor program is an interesting piece of the initiative to give students more support and as a bystander to this juggernaut gives me a chance to actually help. I have taken the free 4-week intro course (focus on HTML, CSS, JS) and really enjoyed the experience and recognize it's a sliver of what Lambda is doing. After taking it, I was inspired to write a note about my impression of Lambda. You can read that here, https://moontowermeta.com/my-reaction-to-lambda-school/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "18   The second I heard about Lambda schools I knew I wanted to contribute. I applied to be an instructor last Fall but I wasn't accepted, which is fair considering my relative lack of experience compared with current Lambda instructors. I'm excited to apply to the Mentor problem as I see a lot of value in how it integrates with Lambda School. The expertise I would bring is that I've been developing mobile apps in Baltimore since 2015. I have had many job interviews in the Baltimore area and I know the vast majority of tech companies around here. Recruiters message me left and right about job openings in my area, so I know there's a demand for developers here. I introduced my girlfriend to Lambda as she was tired of her lack of job mobility and she is now more than halfway through her full stack web dev course and I'm so proud of how far she's come thanks to how much Lambda puts into it's program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "23   I got my start as a programmer (without a formal education) because a Senior Software Engineer at a company in Virginia was willing to take anyone who was eager to learn. In a field where the barrier of entry is often far too high, he inspired me to give back to others as best I can. In the years since, I've become a Senior IT Developer at a health insurance company in Florida. I lead a team of developers that produce a React based Web Application but my duties are in both the front and back end. Since obtaining seniority I've been looking for ways to repay the man who gave me a shot when I came into this field. Being a Lambda Mentor seems like a great way to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "89   I'm a huge fan of Lambda School and the thoughtful approach you've all taken - its income-sharing model that removes the financial burden of a tech education and invests in people's future potential, the apprenticeship model to let companies take a realistic chance on a student rather than judging resumes, and ultimately its impact towards leveling the playing field, particularly for under-valued and under-privileged demographics. I try to structure my life around bridging technical gaps of opportunity, think a lot about building a sustainable and mission-oriented career, and would love to help carve out time and care to the Lambda School as part of that. I've served as a mentor for CODE2040 and Hackbright, and currently serve on the board of a global children's nonprofit while running a data and ML consultancy focused on positive second-order effects in society, along with being an active and early member of a number of unique communities such as South Park Commons and The Cosmos. Hopefully I can help a Lambda student navigate the world of data/ML/AI, make new connections to people in industry, expose them to supportive communities, and go the extra mile with them wherever they may need it most.

Let me know what you think, I’d love to chat over Zoom about how to get involved! \\n\\nMariya                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "164  I am looking to countinue to give back to the tech community and further my outreach work that I started by creating www.studentsatnasa.org.

       "168  I moved to DC a little over a year ago and have been hoping to get involved in some mentoring here as well as make some new connections to the non-tech parts of the city/community, but with work have not been able to commit to a traditional tutoring/mentoring opportunity. However, this looks like it could be a great opportunity to help out given the structure of the program and the need to bridge the gap with your students. I've previously tutored and informally mentored people and really enjoy leveraging networks to help those that didn't go the schools like I did where the connections come organically  -- it's one of the many facets of unevenly distributed opportunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "275  One of the reasons I have pursued a career in technology is the promise of using new technical tools to solve hard problems. But I have learned along the way that even when you feel like you know the tools or know how to solve a problem, there is always a new problem or a new issue to tackle. Having strong mentors has helped me make improvements and grow much more quickly than if I were relying on myself and I am excited about the opportunity to be a resource for Lamda students that are out there learning for themselves and changing their lives.

       "279  I believe that traditional bootcamp schools spend too little time on unrealistic problems to train programmers for real world problems. I like Lambda School’s approach of spending more time.

A multiplicity of life viewpoints is a force multiplier for us. And the right thing to do.

Prior to that, I built an edtech joint venture with National Geographic. I’ve learned a lot about building and designing software products in a holistic fashion.

I know it's a bit early in my career, but I believe I can help point students toward the right direction and help guide them to their first engineering position. During my time at Lambda, I tried my best to help other classmates get ready for the job search, encouraging them to start looking at the job interview process (DS&A, Leetcode, etc.) and working on their resume (mainly encouraging them to start on a personal project). As for my introduction, I was a part of WEB12, and am currently working as a Software Engineer III (working with various technologies, such as Vue, Angular, D3, Sails, SQL, etc.) for Cisco. Again, I'm not too sure if Lambda graduates are allowed to join the program, especially this early, but I would be very excited to have a/some mentee(s)!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "319  I shifted careers to become a software developer and I feel very fortunate that friends had been through the same experiences (bootcamps), friends that I could ask questions too, and that I was able to quickly get a job (while still in the bootcamp). That was 3 years ago, and I still feel lucky today to be a developer. I have encouraged friends that inquired to make the jump, shared resources, looked over resumes and helped with job hunting.

I know that I wish that I had mentors that were easily accessible to me and I want to make sure that if someone feels that way as well, I can be there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "342  The second I heard about Lambda schools I knew I wanted to contribute. I applied to be an instructor last Fall but I wasn't accepted, which is fair considering my relative lack of experience compared with current Lambda instructors. I'm excited to apply to the Mentor problem as I see a lot of value in how it integrates with Lambda School. The expertise I would bring is that I've been developing mobile apps in Baltimore since 2015. I have had many job interviews in the Baltimore area and I know the vast majority of tech companies around here. Recruiters message me left and right about job openings in my area, so I know there's a demand for developers here. I introduced my girlfriend to Lambda as she was tired of her lack of job mobility and she is now more than halfway through her full stack web dev course and I'm so proud of how far she's come thanks to how much Lambda puts into it's program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "387  Hi! Big fan of Lambda school and Austen's vision.  In fact, if my time wasn't already fully committed to two startups then I would have applied for a role at Lambda. I am interested in the mentor program because I know how steep the development learning curve is at first and how discouraging it can be to get \"stuck\" for hours on end. Coding didn't come as naturally to me as it did for others around me and there were countless times where I wished someone was there to guide my hand on \"what to google\" or \"which stackoverflow response was best\". The reward is worth it though and I hope I can help others clear those initial hurdles as well!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
